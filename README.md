## How it's Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This website started with just an image of a layout template. I coded it from scratch knowing I wanted it to be for a trendy hair salon. This was the second static site I built so I had some experience under my belt and I felt comfortable with most of the key concepts needed to build it out. While looking at the layout template, I quickly mapped out the HTML elements in my head to form a rough draft of the content structure. With that in mind, I got started writing the HTML making sure to use proper tags that make the most semantic sense and allow for accessibility options like screen readers. With the site content completed, I got to work on styling with CSS. I built out the core layout first using floats, borders, and placeholder images as a first pass.

## Optimizations
Always keeping responsiveness in mind, I made sure everything looks good on desktop, mobile, and everything in between. I also noticed that the site was rather sluggish at first, so I compressed my image and video files. Much better.

## Lessons Learned
While building this site, I learned that I shouldn't be afraid of trying something new just because it looks complicated. This is the first site I've built that incorporates JavaScript, and I think the interactivity really adds a lot! It didn't take me long at all to follow a tutorial and now I know how to build something new that I can use in any future projects!
